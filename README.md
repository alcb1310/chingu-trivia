# Chingu Trivia

This project is a game where you select a topic and have to answer several questions related to that topic and upon given certain choices you have to select the correct one.  Once you've gone through all the questions it will tell you your score and you will be able to start again

## Deployment

In order to deploy we need to do the following:

### `npm install`

Installs all the project dependencies required fro the app to work.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
